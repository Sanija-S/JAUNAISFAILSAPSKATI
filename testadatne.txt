woooooowza

Šodien ir pirmdiena, 

I can't touch you through the phone
Or kiss you through the universe
In another time zone
It's the only time I can't reverse
But when there's two dimensions
There's only one I'm missin'
And if you feel alone
You don't have to feel that no more

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Uh-uh)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagnе confetti)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D
